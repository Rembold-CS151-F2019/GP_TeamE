# GP_TeamE

We already had a GitHub repo built before you sent out this one, and we ended up doing all of our work there. Since you said you wanted to be able to see who uploaded what files, we figured it would be easier to just redirect you to our repository. So, here it is:
https://github.com/ethan546/escapeMaze

And, in case that link is broken or something, we also uploaded a copy of the master script to this repository. Below is a duplicate of our README.md script from this point in time.




# escapeMaze

How to run the game:
Just run the master.py script. This file works independently, and the other scripts are just there to show the building process before we put everything together.


How to play:
Use the directional arrows to move the player.
Use the mouse to shoot. 
Press 'q' if you need to quit the game.

Your goal is to escape through the maze without getting killed by all the traps and monsters!
Shoot monsters to temporarily stun them!

Note: not all non-master scripts have current versions of their respective classes, since many of the classes were modified in the master script so they would work better with one another.
